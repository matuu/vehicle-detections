TODO:
- Implement JWT for authentication.
- POST /users to create the users.
- Develop GET /stats to return vehicle counting per Make (group_by).
- Add testing
- Re-structure app (folder app, core)

DONE:
- Develop GET /detections endpoint to expose all detections indexed in the database you chose in Indexer Microservice:
    - The response should be paginated. Use skip and limit as the pagination query params.
- Develop GET /alerts endpoint to receive the alerts in real-time:
    - This endpoint should be an event stream.
    - Develop a Kafka Consumer inside the API to consume the alerts and expose them through the /alerts event-stream endpoint.
